# Atingle Executor

>  **NOTE:** This project is currently **non-functional**. While injection into the Sober Roblox client on Linux is working, **no active exploit features are implemented yet.** This project is a **rewrite-in-progress.**

---

## What Doesn't Work (Yet)
- No active exploit functions (e.g., Lua execution, memory hooks)
- No in-game script control or GUI
- Offsets for Sober are not public
